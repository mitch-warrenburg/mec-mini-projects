The databricks documentation is extremely outdated. In fact, it's so outdated that you can't even import a file as text through the UI. You can only select csv, avro or json. All of the UI screenshots in the pdf guide are totally inaccurate now.

Additionally, you can't create a cluster anymore through the app. You must have an AWS account and run a job to create an AWS stack before you can create a cluster. I did this and accepted the expense on my AWS account. But the documentation is years out of date so I can’t go any further. The closest I can get is to import and select csv for the table format. But when I try to import it, there is a new format called “delta” that must be used. Since this notebook is so outdated, I of course get this error:   “A transaction log for Delta was found at `dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/nasa_access_log_jul95_1_gz/_delta_log`,
but you are trying to read from `dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/nasa_access_log_jul95_1_gz` using format("text"). You must use
'format("delta")' when reading and writing to a delta table.”

I’ve worked around the outdated docs before, but I can’t get around this one. Databricks has changed significantly even since I used it in a previous exercise… and it was outdated then too.

This is totally unacceptable. I'm paying a ridiculous amount of money to take a course that has content that's several years old. Most of the videos are 7-8 years old as well… This needs to be fixed or I will consider legal action to get my money back.  There is no way to complete this exercise so I’m simply not going to waste any more time on it.

Am I the only person taking this course? This is truly unbelievable.
